# FindaLyric

A website the user can find lyrics to their favorite songs so that they can tell that guy he has the wrong lyrics and follow their favorite artist's twitter.

### User Story

“Hold me closer, Tony Danza”...
Is there "a bathroom on the right", or "a bad moon on the rise?"...
Wait, is that right?
As a music aficionado, I want to find lyrics to my favorite songs so that I can tell that guy he has the wrong lyrics and follow my favorite artist's twitter.

### Process

Krishna - back-end
Jason - front-end
Matthew - jack-of-all-trades

Apiseeds API used to get the lyrics.
Happi.dev used to get artist image.
Musixmatch used to get the artist Twitter URL.
Twitter api used to get the Twitter feed.
Materialize used as the CSS framework

The challenges we faced were getting our apis to work properly, understanding how they worked, and merging content on Github.

Some successes were getting the apis to return the desired data and feeling good about building a dynamic page.

### Application Requirements

Must use at least two server-side APIs

Must use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap

Must be interactive (i.e: accept and respond to user input)

Use at least one new third-party API

Must have a polished UI
